The dataset includes 248 images.
Football-players are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -0 and +0 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
